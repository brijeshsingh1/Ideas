If you want to get rich remove a step from you process to deliver service. 
Examples: 
  Movie watching: NetFlix eliminated the step to drive to a video store to get a DVD and driving back to teh store to return the DVD on time or incur a fine.
  
  Bank: No one look forward to going to a back and stand in line to see a teller to merely make a deposite. Our bank removed taht step. When they see someone 
  standing in line, they ask are you here to make a deposit, they take the money, fill out the form and let you go immediately. They took away the most time 
  consuming step for their most valuable customers.
  
  Music Indistry: 

If you make the process simpler for the people you provide service and save time for them, they will reward you with money. 

If we are in service industry,which we are. We are in a SaaS Service industry. Whatever you are asking your customers to do, whatever you are asking them to provide. We need really think about do we really need all the infomration we are asking 
our customers to provide. Can we make it simpler for them? We need to keep asking this question.
